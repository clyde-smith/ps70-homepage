<h4 style= "color: blue;">Kinetic Sculpture: Water Wheel</h4>


<p style="color:blue; font-size:18px;"> For my kinetic sculpture I chose to work with the water pump motor. Going into the project I was unsure of what I wanted to do with the pump, but after some exploring, I settled on a water wheel. I figured that going forward, the downhill flow and spin allow for adding various other elements. I also am looking forward to programming this sculpture as it will be quite different from programming a typical rotating motor. <p>

<p style="color:blue; font-size:18px;"> My first assembled version came out like this. I knew that I was missing pieces, but I wasn't exactly sure what was missing or what else I would want to add and change. To figure this out, I chose to cut out all of the peices I had designed up to that point and assemble them. Upon assembly I was able to figure out exactly what was missing and how I wanted the final design to look. I went back into fusion, drew a few new pieces, made some changes and then recut. <p>

<p style="color:blue; font-size:18px;"> This design worked fairly well, with the major flaw being that cardboard is not waterproof. Given the time and materials constraint for this project I was only able to work with cardboard however I would love to remake a plastic, metal, or other waterproof version of this waterwheel. One of the main issues with the cardboard was leakage. As soon as my pools began to fill up, I was already loosing water. This lead to reduced water flow and thus more difficulty spinning the wheel. In the video below I was running the motor at just above ten volts. While this is quite high, I beleive it would work much at much lower power if I was using waterproof materials with tight joints. Additionally, I plan to adjust the angle of each slat slightly so it will have more direct contact with the falling water. <p>
