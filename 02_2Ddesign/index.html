<h4 style="color:darkviolet;">Assignment 1: Box</h4>

<p style="color:darkviolet; font-size:18px;"> I like a very functional box. For this reason, I designed a basic finger jointed box with handles and a sliding lid. The handles serve an obvious purpose, but the lid serves two purposes. The first is that you can knock over your box and stuff won't fall out. The second is that the lid also creates a smaller tray on the top of the box, and this is essential as a place to toss small random items that are used frequently or might get lost in the depths of the full box. <p>

<p style="color:darkviolet; font-size:18px;"> To create a slot for my lid to slide into, I scored two lines on each of the inside faces and then removed the material between them, and cut all the way through on one end so the lid can slide in and out. I did this just above the handles so stuff in the tray would not fall out the handles and just low enough to provide a decent rim. <p>

<p style="color:darkviolet; font-size:18px;"> In order to cut the score lines for the lid on the inside of the box, but the base score lines on the outside, I had to make two seperate cuts. I first cut out all of the box and the base score lines, then flipped my whole piece over, added the score lines for the lid into UCP and recut. The final step, cutting out the lid, I did by hand to ensure a tight fit. Depending on the power you set the score cut to on the laser and depending on how much material you peel out when removing the slots, you require a different sized lid. <p>


<h4 style="color:darkolivegreen;">Assignment 3: Fusion Modeling</h4>

<p style="color:darkolivegreen; font-size:18px;"> For my two objects, I chose a small glass bottle that I currently am growing a plant in, and an adjustable reading light. Altough these are completely unrelated to my main final project idea, they are components of a project I would love to make which is an adjustable grow light for plants. I like having plants in my room, but have very little sunlight. Although there are many grow lights available online, very few actually look nice, are adjustable, and are affordable. I would like to combine all three of these traits and create the most stylish and best functioning grow light a dorm has ever seen. <p>

<p style="color:darkolivegreen; font-size:18px;"> Through the Fusion tutorials and the modeling of these objects I learned how to use a lot of different Fusion operations. I generally started each object with a rectangular, circular, or free line sketch. I then used the extrude tools to expand these sketches into 3D. I also used the shell tool to create my bottle and the pipe tool to create the neck of my lamp. When combining these objects I imported the seperate models into one and then added the base compenent to attatch them. <p>
